2. Abstract factory is an object.
3. Abstract factory method hides the construction of a family of related objects.

Factory
1. Factory method uses the  inheritance to decide which object has to be instantiated.
2. Factory method is a single method.
3. Factory method pattern hides the construction of single object.
